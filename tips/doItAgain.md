# Do It Again

Patterns are funny. If something is funny or even just fun -- do it again. Don’t get too logical here. Just make it happen again. 

    Dad: “Son, it’s your birthday. I know last year I bought you a unicycle and you hated it. I vowed that I would never disappoint you again. So here’s your birthday gift. It’s a unicycle.”

    Son: “Dad! You JUST SAID you’d never disappoint me again! I HATE unicycles!”

    Dad: “Still? I was hoping you’d grow out of that.”

I find that very well trained actors will forget to make patterns, because they are waiting for something to organically motivate them to do the weird thing again. I saw this exchange in a scene recently.

    Car salesman: “Sir, before you look at this Camero, would you like a drink? I find a drink puts people at ease. Plus this is a car meant for people going to cool parties, where there will be drinks! I’m a drinks guy, I guess. What do you say? Have a drink!”

He actually said “I’m a drinks guy.” Which is remarkable considering what happened next.

Someone from the backline changed the scene to show this same car salesman meeting with his boss.

    Boss: “Lenny, I’m considering firing you. Customers don’t like how much you’re pressuring them to drink. Unless you can think of a way to change my mind?”

And what did the guy who had JUST DESCRIBED HIMSELF as a “drinks guy” say in response?

    Car Salesman: “I can’t think of anything to do. Sounds like I’m fired!”

My point is he should have tried to buy his boss a drink. Maybe this is a bad example since the “wrong move” I’m describing above is also hilarious. But I stand by my advice: make patterns.
# Exercise: Repeat the first four lines

Two people up. They should do a four line scene, and then continue the scene — repeating those same four lines over and over. You will be amazed how often this is funny.
