# Big Moment Before

Here’s a pretty easy way to get a scene going with energy: Start a scene assuming that it’s RIGHT AFTER something big has happened. “Big” is relative.

    Someone dropped an engagement ring down the sink.

    The cast list for a high school musical just got announced.

    A rainbow has appeared in the sky. 

SOMETHING happened right before the scene started.

Too many people try to put the big thing in the future.

    “We’re about to find out who got in the musical.”

    “Once we get in there, remember these guys don’t want to hear about our personal lives.” 

But time never moves forward in an improv scene. You will NEVER get to the cast list being announced. You’ll never “get in there.” Easier to have it just before the scene started.

You’re not skipping the fun. You’re starting in the middle.

Example beginnings:

    “Well, that certainly is a dragon.”

    “That car just exploded!”

    “So, I’ve lost the lottery.”

    “The mail is here!”

# Exercise: Big Moment Before
Two at a time, do a scenes where the first line reveals that something has just happened. This a good exercise for the very start of a class to warm everyone up.
