# Exercise
- Three people start off standing in a triangle and face each other; A, B, and C.
-  A starts off by saying a general statement.
-   B will then have to heighten what A had said, all while staying within a similar subject and then C will continue going back to A.

This goes on until somebody says something so ridiculous that it could not be true, at this point the other two improvisers could call bullshit, forcing the improviser to do a monologue justifying their ridiculous move.

If one improviser only calls bullshit then they must leave and allow another improviser up.

    For example: 
    Person A: "I write with a pencil" 
    Person B: "I write using a quill" 
    Person C: "I etch stone tablets" 
    Person A&B: "Bullshit!" 
    Person C: "My father owns a headstone business..."
