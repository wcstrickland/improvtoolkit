# Make It A Debate

If you are unable to say yes to accusations, a really good second choice is to turn things into a philosophical debate.

Fights are boring, but debates are interesting.

Someone accusing someone of being a bad person, followed by a defensive explantion, is tedious.

    “You always skip our child’s concerts!”

    “You know I’ll get fired if I leave work early!” 

But debates are generally compelling.

Take whatever you’re arguing about, and make it universal.

    “You always skip our child’s concerts!”

    “I think attending concerts is not really that big a deal.”

    “What? It matters!”

    “I disagree. I feel that doing good work at my job and bringing home a good salary is far more important.”

    “No, Jake will notice if you aren’t there and it will hurt his feelings!”

    “Hmmm. Okay, I’ll explain to him my job requirements. I bet he understands.”

    “I’m telling you, it’s the little things that matters.”

    “I’ll write him a letter.”

It requires both actors to stop being upset and instead discuss the issues.
# Exercise: Accuse, Philosophize

Two people up. The initaitor opens the scenes by accusing the other person of something. Defend yourself with a philosophy.

    You missed my birthday.

    Yes, I'm sick of living in the past.
