        <h3>Paul Valincort</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Play paranoid</li>
            <li>Say something about what your partner just said</li>
            <ol>
                <li>what did they literally say</li>
                <li>what do I think that means</li>
                <li>how do i think or feel about what they said</li>
                <li>what am i going to do about it</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Press your partner's buttons. "Don't tell me I'm tall" TELL THEM</li>
            <li>You should be in your head some. We are not just actors. The improviser steers a character they don't just ride them. make your character do the fun things</li>
            <li>If a scene seems like it has an obvious conclusion like a seduction scene, remember it is how we get there that is fun. enrich the journey</li>
            <li>Dramatic characters are complex. Comedic characters are simple. If you have a hammer treat everything like a nail. If you are supportive, support the guy robbing you</li>
            <li>Say something about your partner's character. Something about what they think or feel</li>
            <li>If you're stuck start a sentence with "here's the thing". it will force you to address something important</li>
            <li>confessions work the same way</li>
            <li>Say yes and to the other improviser, not exactly the character. Say yes to the game move</li>
            <li>The relationship is the transaction; the activity is the currency. We use what we are doing to advance the relationship</li>
            <li>No one ever left a show and thought, "man... they really fixed that bike"</li>
            <li>Know everything, have everything. Not having what they ask for is a dead end. Knowing a wrong answer is fun, not knowing is the end</li>
            <li>Say yes in spite of your character. If your character is afraid of heights, its your job as the improviser to find a reason for her to say yes to climbing a mountain</li>
            <li>Don't let your character get in the way of the scene</li>
            <li>Be vulnerable to change</li>
            <li>Have, Say, Do</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
