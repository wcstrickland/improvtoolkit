# Choose To Lose

If “when in doubt, confess” is the most useful shortcut I know for making scenes funny, then “choose to lose” is the most powerful. It’s a little bit harder to do, but so valuable that it’s worth practicing. I have rarely seen a bad improv show in which the players were not ignoring this shortcut.

When someone accuses your character of doing something bad, agree that you did it.

Choose to lose.

The very understandable mistake people make is that, when faced with an accusation, they make their characters realistic by providing a reasonable explanation as to why they did something. Like this:

    “Dad, you sold our photo albums?” 

    “Yeah, but it was by accident! I had no idea it was in that box in our yard sale!” 

Top of their intelligence, but also…. kinda boring? And in a way, it’s a denial.

Remember, “accusations are gifts.” If someone asks you why you ordered meat when you knew your date was vegan, they’re not looking for an explanation. They’ve given you a casting breakdown. You are the kind of person who doesn’t care that someone is vegan.

Bonus if you give an emotional reason why.

    “Dad, you sold our photo albums?” 

    “I know. I am mad at the family.”

Less realistic? Yeah. But somehow more emotionally relatable. And a better yes-and.

And: funny.
# Exercise: I did it, and here’s why.

Two people up. 

The first person initiates with an “explain this” accusation. 

    “You want to explain to me why you are wearing my shoes?”

In response the person must admit that they did do this thing, and then have a reason.

    “I deserve them more than you. I’m more fashionable. You’re a slob.”

Any reason will do, but emotional/philosophical ones are better than external circumstance. Remember, you’re not trying to be realistic. You’re trying to be emotionally relatable.

“I deserve them more than you.” is better than “My boyfriend made me!” which is better than “It was an accident! No one caused this and therefore it’s unimportant and the scene is so far meaningless!”
