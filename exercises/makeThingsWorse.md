# Make Things Worse

Don’t solve problems, make problems worse.

If you’re stung by a bee, by all means get lotion for the character. But after you’ve rubbed it on, realize that you’ve accidentally used honey.

Hat tip: this is inspired by a Craig Cackowski exercise which I believe is called “things get worse?” I would happily admit to outright stealing this but I think I’m unintentionally altering how he does it. I guess I’m “making things worse” in the are of teaching the art of “making things worse.”
# Exercise: Make Things Worse

Get 6-8 people up. Give a situation. The group’s mission is to make things worse. Rules: no one can die. Things can temporarily get better. No character MEANS to make things bad.

Pretend a couple is eating a fine diner.

Someone walks on as a waiter and spills wine.

The waiter wants to make things better. “Let me buy you dessert to make up for this.”

The couple responds “We’d love some ice cream.”

Waiter: “Ah, we’re out. all we have is peanut pie.”

Husband: “I’m allergic to peanuts.” Wife: “I’m allergic to pie.”

Watier: “No problem! Drinks are on the house, then, and we’ll get a new glass of wine.” Waiter leaves.

Then the wife’s first husband enters. He’s there’s with his new wife and baby. She is a movie star. The baby is incredible. She’s in an advanced kindergarten class. The wife in the original couple sinks.

“Do you have any kids?” Asks the ex-husband.

“Yes, but he’s a real dud,” says the wife of the main couple.

The waiter comes out and says “I spilled the last of the wine on myself. Can I give you a coupon for another visit?”

“No,” says our husband. “We’re moving to another country tomorrow.”

“Ah! Which one?” Asks the waiter.

“Belgium,” says the husband.

“Waiters are famously terrible there.”

Is this good? I think it’s good.
