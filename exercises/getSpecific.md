# Get Specific

Specifics are funny. If you can come up with them, use them.

Don’t order a steak, get an English Broil.

Don’t say you’ve been married for 20 years, say it’s been 13 months.

Don’t ask to play some basketball, ask to throw around the ‘ol Spaulding.

Don’t say you need to check with your manager, say you have to ask Lorraine.

Be able to come up with: names, foods, cars and companies.
