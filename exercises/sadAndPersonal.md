# Go Sad And Personal

This is especially good in a group game, where everyone is going down the row and trying to top the last person. Let’s say it’s a group game where a family is revealing that everything they brought on this camping trip is useless. When you can’t think of how to top the last one, GO SAD.

“Let’s all say what we’re bringing on this camping trip.”

“I’m bringing a copy machine.”

“I have some extension cords.”

“I have a chiminey”

(And now someone can’t think of what to say)

“I brought my divorce papers. I thought I might need a good cry.”
