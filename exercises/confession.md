# When In Doubt, Confess

The idea is that if you feel the scene has stalled, and you’re not sure what to do next, have your character confess something.I t was taught to me just like that: When in doubt, confess.

    “I’ve been meaning to tell you this, but I’ve quit my job.”

It’s easy to see WHY a confession is good for a scene: it’s by definition personal, important and a surprise.

What surprises me is how often it works and how well it works.

How often it works: I think you could do it in every scene and it would not stop working. Even clumsily. You could say, in every scene, “I have a confession to make...” -- that exact phrase -- and it would still work.

How well it works: even with very new improvisers, the confessions they make tend to be specific and gripping. Players who normally have trouble thinking of even a single name for the other character, and who get lost trying to improv brush their own teeth, if you ask them to make a confession, will turn to their scene partners and say: “Sweetheart, I’m buying a falcon.”

# Exercise: Yeah, We Knew That

Four people up. They are going to play friends hanging out. Each of them has a big confession to make. When the scene starts, they should establish a where and almost immediately start confessing things.

    “I’ve got a confession to make. I’ve been stealing money at work.”

Confessions can be big or small, silly or realistic.

In response: the other friends reveal they already knew about it. “Yeah, we knew.”  They give reasons why they knew already. This “yes ands” the confession and fleshes out the world.

Note: It does not hurt the scene that everyone decides to know. Being offended just slows down a scene.

Generally, it’s the content of the confession that helps, not that it had been kept a secret.
