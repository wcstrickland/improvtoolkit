heightening the dynamic a little, so the second player might offer “I bake great organic
cookies.” This process of gentle amplification continues until the exercise reaches a
natural conclusion. Then return to the beginner player and have them repeat the same
sentence and go in the opposite direction, focusing on heightening a new element of the
sentece. Then do it a 3rd time expanding on theme instead of specifics. So first time is "I
bake great cookies".."I bake great organic cookies"..."I bake great organic cookies from
scratch"..etc. 2nd round is maybe focuses on the 'great part' or the WHY "I bake great
cookies to stunt on all the other grandma's in the neighborhood". 3rd round expands
thematically. "I bake great cookies"... "I wear an apron around the house"..."I have a bow
full of candies"..."I give the best hungs"..."I had my hip replace" (grandma theme). Do it
a 4th time and say the same sentence but heighten the same emotion or sentiment</p></li>
