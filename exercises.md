• 5 things
• Mind Meld
• "Did ya ever". One word at a time story. Starts with on player saying "did ya ever" then
each player after building a story one word at a time until a natural conclusion. Do with
Hillbilly accent, etc
• Distillation. pair in scene. 1 min scene. After that each player only gets 3 lines to portray
the same scene. After that, each player only gets 1 line
• End class/workshop with "Campfire". Everyone circles up, the center is a fire that
represents the class that day. At their own pace, the players grab a 'log' and throw it onto
the fire as they describe something they learned/appreciate/or want to work on during
class.
• 'Hitchhiker" 2 actors in a car, everyone else is lined up. 2 actors must establish a
relationship and why they are in the car. Once relationship is established, 3rd actor sticks
thumb out as an exaggerated character and in a characteristic voice asks if they're headed
to (destination). Original 2 actors immediately take on all the characteristics of Actor 3.
They cruise down the road for a bit, having a grand time. Then driver makes and excuse
to bail. Actor 3 gets in front seat and the drill starts over.
• "Can't Complete Your Own \_\_\_\_". Standard scene but neither player can complete their
own sentence. Scene partner must complete the sentence then start a new sentence which
then they cannot complete. And on and on.
• Card Status Murder. 4 players are each given a random card from a deck. Card indicates
status. Scene must play out with each acting out their own status. During scene players
must die in order lowest to highest status. When one person is left, they are the killer and
must give a monologue explaining how they did it and why.
• "Little Voice". Actor B is seated off stage. Actor A walks onto stage, they are on their way
to/from somewhere. Actor B is the voice of a small imaginary creature who can talk.
Actor A immediately sees them, honestly reacts, and makes an obvious statement about
the creature so they audience immediately knows.
• What's In the Kitchen?
• "Guess What Happens Next? Exactly!" One player starts telling a true story and at a
certain point pauses and says "and guess what happens next?", other player offers a
suggestion and player A enthusiastically responds "Exactly!" and continues to tell the
story in the new arc. This can be in pairs or in front of the class.
• "Monkey in the Middle" 3 actors, 2 scenes. Actor in middle starts scene with actor on
left, scene gets a little ways in and actor on right repeats one of the lines of dialogue.

Middle actor then switches to new scene responding to the same line but in a different
context.
• "Pass it Along" large group of players line up with space in between them. Actor at back
of line is given an action to mime. They tap the person in front of them and mime the
action. next actor does the same and so on until we get to the last 2. Last two must start a
scene based off mutually doing this same action.
• "Dear Diary" One player rights in their diary as a character. Audience will yell out a time
jump. Player flips page and jumps to that date and starts a new entry along the same
timeline.
• Ding Deeper. When bell is rung, scene must enter a deeper emotional state. This can be
triggered off of a line, action, or every 20 seconds.
• Directors Commentary. 2 actors start a scene. Director off to the side interjects and gives
anecdotes about whats happening in the scene, details of drama on set, details of the
story, anything pertaining to what's happening. Actors then resume scene incorporating
what was mentioned. Give and take exercise kwith focus on pointing out the obvious.
• Problem/Solution: Player A comes up with a problem. Player B grabs nearby object grabs
a nearby object and presents it as a solution to the problem. Player A gladly accepts the
object and explains how it will be used to solve the problem.
• Reinvention: Object is grabbed and demonstration given of how to use object. Next
person takes object and uses it in a different way. When all variations are exhausted,
choose new object.
• Word Train: Circled up, build a series of words joined together by free association. Ex:
Cat, Burglar, Alarm, System, Failure, To Launch, Pad, Cushion, Fall, Back, Pack, etc etc
etc. Idea is to build memory and listening whilst contributing in a way that helps the team
build a longer train.
• Family Portrait: 4/5 players are up. They are given prompts to portray. "Alien Family.
Worried Family. Chicken Family. Circus family, etc" They strike those poses. (This game
can be further extrapolated into generating strong characters for a scene)
• Pass the Face: Circle up. One player makes a face and then makes eye contact with
someone who has to make the same face then generate a new face and pass it along with
eye contact. Add sound effects or phrasing.
• Remember that Time: Like other group story telling games but framed as a collectively
shared memory. Everyone has a unique viewpoint on what happened and what they
individually experienced.
• 'Bullshit' Three people start off standing in a triangle and face each other; A, B, and C. A
starts off by saying a general statement. B will then have to heighten what A had said, all
while staying within a similar subject and then C will continue going back to A. This

goes on until somebody says something so ridiculous that it could not be true, at this
point the other two improvisers could call bullshit, forcing the improviser to do a
monologue justifying their ridiculous move. If one improviser only calls bullshit then
they must leave and allow another improviser up. For example: Person A: "I write with a
pencil" Person B: "I write using a quill" Person C: "I etch stone tablets" Person A&B:
"Bullshit!" Person C: "My father owns a headstone b
• Heightening Circle: players form a circle and one player volunteers to go first. This
player offers up a simple sentence, often a personal brag or observation, such as “I bake
great cookies.” The game now moves around the circle with each sequential contributor
heightening the dynamic a little, so the second player might offer “I bake great organic
cookies.” This process of gentle amplification continues until the exercise reaches a
natural conclusion. Then return to the beginner player and have them repeat the same
sentence and go in the opposite direction, focusing on heightening a new element of the
sentece. Then do it a 3rd time expanding on theme instead of specifics. So first time is "I
bake great cookies".."I bake great organic cookies"..."I bake great organic cookies from
scratch"..etc. 2nd round is maybe focuses on the 'great part' or the WHY "I bake great
cookies to stunt on all the other grandma's in the neighborhood". 3rd round expands
thematically. "I bake great cookies"... "I wear an apron around the house"..."I have a bow
full of candies"..."I give the best hungs"..."I had my hip replace" (grandma theme). Do it
a 4th time and say the same sentence but heighten the same emotion or sentiment
• Disaster House. (Vince exercise)
• Dumb Dumb Convention. Name Name Business. Drill. Two people introduce themselves
and their profession, then they mutually decide they should start a new business that
combines their own independent businesses. “My name is Twizzler Cornerstore and I
make candy“. ... “my name is Dingus Waphouse and I am a massage therapist”... “we
should start a spa exfoliating people with sugar” then name the business “Sweet
Rubbbins!”
• I AM INVINCIBLE
• WORLDS WORST
• SCENE PAINTING INTO SCENE: 5-6 people on back line. One by one they add a
feature or an object to the room. Each addition must complement the one before. When
they are done have two people up to start a scene in the room. They must find a
motivation to use each piece of the painted scene.
• RUMOR HAS IT: Similar to telephone, a person whispers a rumor about themselves to
the person mext to them in a circle. That person then embellishes on the rumor for the
next person. And so on and so forth until it gets back to that person and then they have to
flesh out the entire thing.
• EXCUSES: Circle up. One person asks another an accusation question like "why didn't
you do the dishes??" That player must then make up an excuse on the spot. Sillier the
better! To involve more people you have have another random player come come forword
to either corroborate the story or challenge it.
• FORTUNATE ME: Player 1 states a goal they'd like to accomplish in the future. Player
2 responds "unfortunately..." and gives them an obstacle to that goal. Player 1 then
responds with "Well fortunately..." and presents a way to overcome the obstacles.
